Bloons Tower Defense: Bloons Tower Defense is a Tower Defense game played on a track over several rounds. In each round, a set number of Bloons (balloons) spawn at the start location of the track, moving towards the end of the track. The goal is to pop all of the bloons before they reach the end of the track. If a Bloon reaches the end of the track, the number of lives decreases (the game starts with 100 lives), and the game is lost when the number of lives reaches 0. To pop the Bloons, towers are available to buy with money that is given at the start of the game, and these towers pop the Bloons. Money is also earned by popping Bloons, and it is also earned at the end of each round. Bloons come in many different types, which affects how fast they move through the track and how much damage they are able to take before being fully popped. To increase the effectiveness of the towers, upgrades are available, and purchasing upgrades will also cost money.

Run Instructions: Open BTD.pde and click "Run".
